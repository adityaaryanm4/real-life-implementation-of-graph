# real-life-implementation-of-graph
From this implementation , we can get a glimpse of how graph works in real life. Graph is just a "structure" to store a type of data.
For example, we have a data: person1 person2 person3 are all connected to each other. So we need a way to store such data. 
Graph is simply a name. We should focus on the structure, we will get what "graph" is.
